Building a website is full of fun and a sense of achievement. Markdown has been a popular technique for fullfilling the content of the website due to the efficiency and beauty.  
So I decided to learn about it and write down my very first blog to record the key point.

Making Italic font?

_blablabla_ means _blablabla_

Making bold font?

**blablabla** means **blablabla**

Making header?

# [](#header-means-first-level-header-header-means-second-level-header-etc "header means first level header, ## header means second level header etc.")header means first level header, ## header means second level header etc.

Making link?

`[Visit GitHub!](www.github.com)` means making a hyperlink of Visit GitHub! which point to the address of www.github.com e.g Visit GitHub!

Making a reference link?

reference link means every link with the same name which is set by author is point to the same address which means every time you want to change the address of a name, you just need to update one place.e.g  
Do you want to see something fun?

> To do this, replace “see somthing fun” whith [see something fun][a fun place] and add [a fun place]:www.zombo.com to the end of the page to specify that the address.  
> Adding an image?

![](http://octodex.github.com/images/octdrey-catburn.jpg) means showing a image.

Adding a reference image link.

[The first father][first father]  
[The second first father][second father]  
![first father](http://octodex.github.com/images/founding-father.jpg)  
![second father](http://octodex.github.com/images/foundingfather_v2.png)

Blockquotes mark?

‘>blabla’

means >blabla

Unordered list

*   Milk
*   Eggs  
    By adding * before each element.

Inline Code

Inline code is indicated by surrounding it with backticks: `Inline code`

ordered list:

1.  Crack three eggs over a bowl
2.  Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl
3.  Rub the salmon vigorously with butter
4.  Drop the salmon into the egg-milk bowl

Sublist:

1.  Tintin  
    …A reporter  
    …Has poofy orange hair  
    …Friends with the world’s most awesome dog  
    …To do this, add indentation before the second line.  
    …paragraphs(soft break)

First hard break the place where you want to make soft break, then just insert 2 spaces after there.

So far, these are what I have learned and used.
